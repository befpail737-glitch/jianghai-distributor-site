                    <h2>1. Solution Introduction</h2>
                    <p>Grid-scale Energy Storage Systems (ESS) are essential for stabilizing the power grid and enabling the growth of renewable energy. The Power Conversion System (PCS) within a Battery ESS (BESS) is the critical interface between the batteries and the grid. Its DC-Link capacitors must endure decades of service, handling continuous, high-power charge and discharge cycles. This solution combines the immense bulk capacitance of screw terminal capacitors with the reliability of film capacitors to create a PCS front-end built for maximum endurance.</p>

                    <h2>3. Core Advantages of this Solution</h2>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Extreme Durability & Lifespan:</strong> A hybrid bank of long-life screw terminal and film capacitors provides a solution designed to match the 20+ year lifespan of the battery installation.</li>
                        <li><strong>High Cycle Endurance:</strong> Film capacitors handle high-frequency switching ripple, while the large screw terminal capacitors provide the bulk energy storage, protecting both from excessive stress and extending their operational life.</li>
                        <li><strong>Scalability:</strong> This modular approach allows for the creation of multi-megawatt capacitor banks by paralleling components to meet any power requirement.</li>
                        <li><strong>Safety and Reliability:</strong> Utilizes proven, robust components designed for the demands of utility-scale power electronics.</li>
                    </ul>
