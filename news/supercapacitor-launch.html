                <h1>Jianghai Announces New High Power Density Supercapacitor Series</h1>
                <p class="article-meta">Published: June 1, 2025</p>
                <div class="article-content">
                    <p>Our manufacturing partner, Jianghai, has officially announced the launch of their next-generation supercapacitor modules, the ECH series. This new series targets applications requiring high power density for peak power assist and short-term backup power, such as in smart meters, industrial robotics, and regenerative braking systems.</p>
                    <p>Key features of the new ECH series include:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Higher Energy Density:</strong> Up to 20% more energy stored in the same physical footprint compared to the previous generation.</li>
                        <li><strong>Lower ESR:</strong> Reduced internal resistance allows for higher discharge power and improved efficiency.</li>
                        <li><strong>Extended Operating Temperature Range:</strong> Certified for operation in more demanding thermal environments.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>As an authorized distributor, Hongxin Electronics will have priority access to stock and samples of the new ECH series. We are excited to work with our customers to integrate this leading-edge technology into their next-generation products. Please <a href="../contact.html">contact our sales team</a> for preliminary datasheets and sample requests.</p>
