                <h1>Recap: Hongxin Electronics Hosts Technical Seminar on High-Frequency Power Design</h1>
                <p class="article-meta">Published: May 15, 2025</p>
                <div class="article-content">
                    <p>Last week, Hongxin Electronics was proud to host over 50 design engineers from leading companies in the renewable energy and industrial automation sectors for a technical seminar focused on "Passive Component Selection for High-Frequency Power Design."</p>
                    <p>Led by our Senior FAE, John Doe, the session dove deep into the challenges and opportunities presented by the industry's shift towards wide-bandgap semiconductors like SiC and GaN.</p>
                    <p>Key topics included:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>The critical impact of ESR and ESL in DC-Link capacitors operating above 100kHz.</li>
                        <li>A comparative analysis of Film vs. Electrolytic capacitor technologies in high-ripple applications.</li>
                        <li>Thermal modeling techniques to accurately predict capacitor lifetime.</li>
                        <li>A preview of upcoming ultra-low inductance components from Jianghai.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>The event concluded with a lively Q&A session and a hands-on look at product samples. We thank all who attended and look forward to our next event. For those who missed it, key presentation materials can be found in our <a href="../support/index.html">Technical Support</a> section.</p>
